# UX

Notes on UX and UI:

* Use multiples of 8 to define dimensions, margin, and padding for components (8pt grid).
* Use multiples of 8 to define line height and multiples of 4 or 8 to define font size.
* When [scaling up font size](https://gridlover.net/) with CSS, use `rem` units with a ratio of `1.618`
(the golden ratio).
